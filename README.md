# BC-G4s

This repository contains all candidate breast-cancer-associated G-quadruplex (G4) sequence coordinates in the human genome under the genome assembly of **hg19**.

## Files
`BC_G4_merge.bed`: the coordinates of the breast-cancer-associated G-quadruplex (BC-G4) sequences in the human genome.

The BC-G4 data were derived from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number GSE152216 and GSE181373.

This file consists of 3 columns, each representing the chromosome number, start and end coordinates of the G4 sequence.

## Usage
To use the BC-G4 coordinates in your research or analysis, you can download the `BC_G4_merge.bed` file from this repository.
